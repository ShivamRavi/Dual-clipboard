# Dual-clipboard
A python program that uses the keyboard module to allow you to have two independant clipboards at the same time with customizable shortcuts and a basic tkinter gui. (dont need to use that)

## Quick Setup
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install keyboard clipboard
   ```
3. Run the script (try it out in notepad first)

## Default Shortcuts
- **Copy to Clipboard 1**: `Ctrl + Shift + 1`
- **Copy to Clipboard 2**: `Ctrl + Shift + 2`
- **Paste from Clipboard 1**: `Ctrl + Alt + 1`
- **Paste from Clipboard 2**: `Ctrl + Alt + 2`

### For new shortcuts
Just edit them in the script - look for the "EDIT SHORTCUTS HERE" section

## Exit
Hit `ESC` when you're done, and the program will clean up after itself.

> **Note**: You might (only might ok) need to run this as administrator since it uses keyboard inputs.
